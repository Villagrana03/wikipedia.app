                <h2>Pointers</h2>
                <p>Pointers are a concept found primarily in languages like C and C++ that allow direct access to memory by "pointing" to the location where data is stored. A pointer is essentially a variable that holds the memory address of another variable, rather than holding an actual data value.</p>

                <h3>Key concepts of Pointers</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bondClass">Memory Address</span>: Each piece of data in a program is stored in a specific location in memory, which has an address. A pointer variable holds this memory address.</li>
                    <li><span class="bondClass">Dereferencing</span>: Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory address it points to. In C and C++, this is done using the * operator.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Syntax and Basics</h3>

                <div class="blackCoding">
                    <p>
                        <span class="blue">Must have the same variable type in order to access the address</span> <br>
                        int a = 5; <br>
                        int *p = &a;  <span class="lightGreen">// p is a pointer to int, holding the address of a</span> <br>
                        <span class="lightGreen">//& is the address-of operator, and * is the dereference operator.</span>

                <h4>*</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="boldClass">* (Dereference Operator)</span>: Used to access or modify the value at the address stored in a pointer. For example, *ptr gives the value at the address stored in ptr.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>&</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="boldClass">& (Address-of Operator)</span>: Used to get the address of a variable. For example, &value gives the memory address where value is stored.</li>

                <h3>What is Dereferencing?</h3>
                <p>Dereferencing is the process of accessing or modifying the value stored at the memory address that a pointer is pointing to. When you dereference a pointer, you use the * operator to go to the address stored in the pointer and access or change the value at that address.</p>

                <div class="blackCoding">
                    <p>
                        int value = 42; <br>
                        int *ptr = &value;  <span class="lightGreen">// ptr now holds the address of value</span> <br>
                        int dereferencedValue = *ptr; <span class="lightGreen">// dereferencing ptr to get the value (42)</span>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Types of Pointers</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="boldClass">Null Pointer</span>: Points to nothing (nullptr in C++).</li>
                    <li><span class="boldClass">Void Pointer</span>: Can point to any data type but cannot be directly dereferenced.</li>
                    <li><span class="boldClass">Dangling Pointer</span>: Points to memory that has been freed.</li>
                    <li><span class="boldClass">Wild Pointer</span>: Uninitialized pointer with an arbitrary address.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pointer Arithmetic</h3>
                <p>Pointers support operations like incrementing and decrementing to navigate contiguous memory, especially useful with arrays.</p>
