                <p>SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size</p>

                    <h3>order by, limit, case</h3>
                    <p>We can sort the results using ORDER BY, either alphabetically or numerically. Sorting the results often makes the data more useful and easier to analyze.</p>
                    <p>"<span class="red">limit</span>" We’ve been working with a fairly small table (fewer than 250 rows), but most SQL tables contain hundreds of thousands of records. In those situations, it becomes important to cap the number of rows in the result.  For instance, imagine that we just want to see a few examples of records.</p>
                    <p>A <span class="orange">CASE</span> statement allows us to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL’s way of handling if-then logic.</p>
